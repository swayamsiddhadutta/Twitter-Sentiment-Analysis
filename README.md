# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is one of the interesting areas of data science to work in.Sentiment Analysis is done using various kinds of datasets.
Twitter is one of the major sources of performing analysis of sentiments.And this has been done by a lot of data scientists.
I felt that I would be able to learn a lot in Natural Language Processing(NLP) and data science,in general through this project.

Basically what I've tried to do in this project is a step-wise progression towards finding an optimum model that would classify a sentence as either of positive class or of negative class.

The steps involved here are:
a)Data preparation
b)Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and various kinds of data visualizations.
c)Exploring benefits of "n_grams" and "stop words".
d)Using CountVectorizer() and TfIdfVectorizer() for creating word vectors.
e)Using dense matrices for creating word embeedings using word2vec.
f)Training a neural network based on logistic regression classifier and various kinds of vectorizers and comparing the results.
